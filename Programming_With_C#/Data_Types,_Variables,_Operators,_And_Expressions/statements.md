# Statements

In C#, **a statement is considered a command**. Statements perform some action in your code such as calling a method or performing calculations. Statements are **also used to declare variables and assign values to them**. 

Statements are formed from **tokens**. These tokens can be keywords, identifiers (variables), operators, and the statement terminator which is the semicolon (;). All statements in C# must be terminated with a semicolon.
