# Abstract Data Type

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Polymorpism allows you to treat subclasses as their superclass and yet
// call the correct overwritten methods in the subclass automatically

class Animal{
	public:
		virtual void makeSound(){ cout << "The Animal says grrrr" << endl; }

		// The Animal class could be a capability class that exists
		// only to be derived from by containing only virtual methods
		// that do nothing

};

class Cat : public Animal{
	public:
		void makeSound(){ cout << "The Cat says meow" << endl; }

};

class Dog : public Animal{
	public:
		void makeSound(){ cout << "The Dog says woof" << endl; }

};

// An abstract data type is a class that acts as the base to other classes
// They stand out because its methods are initialized with zero
// A pure virtual method must be overwritten by subclasses

class Car{
	public : 
		virtual int getNumWheels() = 0;
		virtual int getNumDoors() = 0;
};

class StationWagon : public Car{
	public :
		int getNumWheels() { cout << "Station Wagon has 4 Wheels" << endl; }
		int getNumDoors() { cout << "Station Wagon has 4 Doors" << endl; }
		StationWagon() { }
		~StationWagon();

};

int main(){

	Animal* pCat = new Cat;
	Animal* pDog = new Dog;

	pCat -> makeSound();
	pDog -> makeSound();

	// Create a StationWagon using the abstract data type Car
	Car* stationWagon = new StationWagon();

	stationWagon -> getNumWheels();

	return 0;
}
```
