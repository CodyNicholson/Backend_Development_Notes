Agile is a type of Test Driven Development


1. Write a test that fails

Create a test case that would pass if the software was complete, but it isn't complete yet so it will fail


2. Make only enough to pass the tests

Make all of those test cases pass by developing the software only enough to pass the test cases


3. Refactor

Modify the code to make it more readable and maintainable, then restart this process from step one
