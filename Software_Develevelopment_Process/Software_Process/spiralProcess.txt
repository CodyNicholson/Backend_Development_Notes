The Spiral Model is an incremental risk-oriented lifecycle model that has four main phases:


1. Determine Objectives:

Define requirements


2. Identify and Resolve Risks:

Identify risks and create prototype


3. Development and Tests

Develop the code  and create tests based on the prototype and the risks defined in the last step


4. Plan the next Iteration

Evaluate the ouput of the current iteration and plan the next iteration



Advantages:

Reduced risk since the process is so iterative

Functionality can be added easily

Software produced early and then constantly improved with early customer feedback


Disadvantages:

The risk analysis requires a highly specific expertise

The whole process is dependant on risk analysis

More complex than other models, like the waterfall modal
