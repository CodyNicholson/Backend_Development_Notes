Architectural Evolution:


When a system evolves, ideally its perscriptive architecture should be modified first

Change the blueprint before you change the system!

In practice, this is often skipped because of short dealines, lack of documentation, or sloppiness but it should be done



Architectural Degradation:

There are two important concepts that have to do with the way a software system evolves, Drift and Erosion



Architectural drift:

Introduction of architectural design decisions orthogonal to a system's prescriptive architecture

This happens when you add new things to the system without proper planning, causing the system to become awkward and impractical



Architectural erosion:

Introduction of architectureal design decisions that violate a system's perscriptive architecture

We are introducing decisions that don't comply with the perscriptive architecture

The result is architecture of poor quality
