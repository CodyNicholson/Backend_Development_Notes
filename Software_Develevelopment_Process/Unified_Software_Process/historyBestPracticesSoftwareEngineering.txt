In 1997, Rational Unified Process defined six best practices for modern softwhere engineering


1. Develop iteratively, focusing on risk


2. Manage requirements, including updating them and keeping traceability information between requirements and other software artifacts


3. Employ a component-based architecture, have a high level design that focuses on cooperating components that are nevertheless very cohesive and highly decoupled


4. Model software visually, use visual diagrams, in particular UML diagrams, in a very extensive way so as to make artifacts easier to understand and agree upon among stakeholders


5. Continuously verify quality, since the process is defined in an iterative way, it allows for performing quality assurance activities in a countinuous way throughout development


6. Control changes, change management and control were also at the center of the rational approach
