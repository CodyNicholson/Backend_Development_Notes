We talk to the customer and the stakeholders and try to decide what kind of system to build

-

##Design:

We use the details provided by the customer/stakeholders to create a design for our software system

-

##Implementation:

We start to write the code and build the software system

-

##Verification and Validation:

We need to test our code to verify that if behaves like intended

-

To maintain that code we might need to add new functionality, eleminate bugs from the code, or respond to feeback from the systems users
