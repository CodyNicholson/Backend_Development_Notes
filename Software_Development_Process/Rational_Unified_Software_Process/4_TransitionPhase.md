#Transition Phase

If we are ready to go to the market and to deploy our product then we can move to the Transition phase which has to do with deployment and maintenance of the system

***

####The main activities in the Transition phase are:

1. Issues after deployment will normally manifest after the first release, and users might report failures or new feature requests - We fix these problems as quickly as we can and then release our fixed product

-

2. Other activities that occur in this phase include training, customer service, providing help-line assistance

-

3. A new cycle may start before the current cycle finishes, so there might be some activities related to the fact that we are starting a new cycle

***

####The outcome of the Transition phase is:

1. The complete project with all the artifacts that we mentioned before

2. The product will be in the hands of the users in the real-world

3. Lessons learnt, what worked and what didn't work, what should we do differently in the next cycle or in next development

   Very important because it provides feedback in cycles and between projects so we can improve for next time

4. A plan for the next release

***

###Evaluating the Transition phase

1. Is the user satisfied? Check their feeback

2. Are actual resourced expenditures versus planned expenditures still acceptable with respect to our estimates?

   This may lead to further maintenance of the system, for example, if we need to adjust to the costs of fixing bugs and responding to user requests
