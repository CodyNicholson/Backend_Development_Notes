The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is Use Case Driven

A system is something that performs a sequence of actions in responce to user input

The user submits some requests, or requests some functionality, and the system responds to those requests

Use Cases capture this interaction and answer the question "What is the system supposed to do for EACH user?", they represent what the system can do for each of the different types of users of the system

For this reason, in RUP, Use Cases are a central element of the whole development lifecycle, and are used in every phase
