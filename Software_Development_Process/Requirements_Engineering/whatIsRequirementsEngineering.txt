Requirements Engineering (RE) is the process of establishing the services that the customer requires of the software system

And

RE is also the constraints under which the system operates and is developed



RE is important because:


Many errors come from incorrect RE, and they will become expensive to fix the longer they are avoided

After the RE is done, you will have the Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

RE is all about being as specific as possible in defining WHAT you want to develop so you can avoid errors

Do not focus on the HOW in this step
