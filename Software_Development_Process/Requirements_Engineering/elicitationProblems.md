#Elicitation Problems

Requirements elicitation is the practice of collecting the requirements of a system from users, customers and other stakeholders

-

##There are many communication errors that can happen in this process:

####Thin spread of domain knowledge:

Knowledge is rarly available in an explicit form

It is often distributed among many sources

There are often conflicts between knowledge between different sources

-

####Knowledge is tacit:

Someone may describe something as if it is simple and has very few steps because they do it all the time when it may actually be a lot more complex

-

####Limited Observability:

Identifying requirements through observation is often very difficult

People don't react well to being studied

-

####Bias:

People might not want or feel free to tell you what you need to know
