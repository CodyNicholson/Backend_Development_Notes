Refactoring is a powerful tool but does have some risks:


You may introduce subtle faults by refactoring

Refactoring should not be abused, it should only be used when needed to improve the design of the code

Should be used carefully on systems in production because this is so late in the process that it could be expensive to fix



Refactoring also has costs:


It can be free if you use tools, but in many cases you will have to do manual work

When you refactor there will be test development and maintnance costs since you will need new test cases for your code

Applying refactoring may involve chages in interfaces, names of classes and such which means the documentation will have to be updated and that has a cost
