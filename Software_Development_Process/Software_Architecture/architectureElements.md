#Architecture Elements

A software architecture typically should not be a uniform monolith

It should be a composition and interplay of different elements

-

####There are three main types of elements:

1 - Processing Elements

Implements the business logic and preform transformations on data

-

2 - Data/Information/State Elements

Contains the information that is transformed by the processing elements

-

3 - Interaction Elements

The glue that holds the parts of the architecture together

***

The Processing Elements and the Data Elements are contained in the system components

The Interaction Elements are maintained and controlled by the system's connectors

The system Componenets and Connectors all get put together in a systems configeration
