A system cannot fufill its purpose until it is deployed

Deploying a system involves physically placing a systems executable modules on the hardware devices where they are supposed to run

You are basically mapping your components and connectors to specific hardware elements resulting in a Deployment Architectural Perspective Diagram

The Deployment View of an architecture can be critical to assessing whether the system will be able to satify its requirements because creating this mapping allows you to discover and assess other characteristics of your system that you might not have considered

Lnowing the characteristics of your hardware allows you to know whether there will be enough memory to run the system, will the system consume too much power,  does the system have enough required network bandwidth, and other important details
