#Intro to White-Box Testing

The one basic assumption we make in White-Box Testing is that executing the faulty statement is necessary condition for revealing a fault

In other words, if there is a bug in the program there is no way we are going to be able to find this bug or fault if we don't execute the statement that contains it

***

###Advantages

It is based on the code, and because of this the quality of white-box testing can be measured objectively

Since it can be measured objectively is can also be measured automatically by building tools to do so

White-Box Testing can be used to compare test suites to find out which one is more effective at testing your code

Allows for covering the coded behavior of the software, meaning that if there is some mistake in the code that is not obvious by looking at the specification of the code white-box testing might be able to catch it because it tries to exercide the code

***

####There are many different types of White-Box Testing:

- Control-flow based techniques

- Data-flow based techniques

- Fault-based techniques

For each of the above families of techniques there are many variations of each, so White-Box Testing is very broad
