The terms Failure, Fault, and Error are often used interchangably when they each actually have their own unique definition that is important to know in Software Testing


As Defined by the IEEE:


Failure

An observable incorrect behavior of the software

It is conceptually related to the behavior of the program rather than its code



Fault

Also called 'bug'

An incorrect piece of code, in other words, a fault is related to the code and is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurance of a failure



Error

An error is the cause of a fault

It is usually a human error, which can be conceptual, a typo, or something along those lines
