#Intro to Black-Box Testing

Black Box Testing, also called functional testing, is a type of software testing that focuses on the input domain so it can test the important behaviors of the software

Black-Box Testing does not need the code so you can design your test cases before writing the code which helps prevent sloppy test case creation that often happens at the end of a project cycle

Since it focuses on the description of what the software should do it can catch logical defects

Black-Box Testing is applicable at all granularity levels -- Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, etc
