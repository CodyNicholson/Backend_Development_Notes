#Unified Modeling Language Structure Diagrams

Unified Modeling Language Structure Diagrams are the diagrams that represent static characteristics of the system we need to model

This is in contrast with dynamic models, which instead represent behaviors of the system we need to model

**

###UML Class Diagram

Static, structured view of the system

Describes classes and their structure and relationships among classes

A class consists of three parts:


  ####Class Name:

  The class name which should be named using the vocabulary of the domain and the name should be a noun starting with a capital letter

-

  ####Class Attributes:

  The second part of the class are the private attributes of the class where the set of attributes for the class define the state of the class

  We can define the attribute simply by name, or we can list more info like its type and initial value

  We use a minus sign to list the attributes because they are private

  Attributes represent the structure of a class, the individual data items that compose the state of a class

  Attributes may be found by examining class definitions, studying requirements, and applying domain knowledge

-

  ####Class Operations:

  The third part of the class consists of the operations of the class

  These public operations are listed by name with a list of arguements and result types for each operation

  We use a plus sign to list the operations because they are public

  Represents the behavior of a class

  May be found by examining interactions among entities
