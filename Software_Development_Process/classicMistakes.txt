Classic mistakes made in the Software Development Process


People Mistakes:


Heroics:


This is the person who thinks they can do everything on their own

The problem is that it discourages cooperation and encourages extreme risk taking

Forces someone to take on lots of responsiblity

Ends in failure

  What you want instead:

Apply software engineering principles

Have collaboration without too much weight on individuals



Work Environment:


There is evidence that the work environment has an effect on overall productivity of the workers



People Management:


Poor leadership leads to poor productivity

Adding people to a project that is behind schedule always ends in failure because they need to get past the learning curve



Process Mistakes:


Scheduling Issues:


Give yourself more time than you think you need to be safe

Don't overestimate the abilities of people involved



Planning Issues:


If you don't plan correctly, you are planning to fail



Failures:


Failure can occur if the quaity of the product is low, or not tested well enough



Product Mistakes:


Gold Plating of Requirements:


It is very common for products to have more requirements then they need

Lengthens the project development unnecessarily



Feature Creep:


Adding more and more features then were initially planned that are not needed



Research != Development:


If you need to use new techniques or learn new knowledge to create the project, you will be doing more research then development



Technology Mistakes:


Silver Bullet Syndrome:


Too much reliance on the advertisment benefits on previously unused technology

We cannot expect technology alone to solve our software development problems



Switching or Adding Tools:


Adds a steep learning curve to the devs that can pull the project backwards



No Version Control:


Version control is far too beneficial to ignore in the software dev process

Without version control the project can get out of hand and no one will remember what code does what
