#Choosing a Process Model

When choosing a Software Process Modal these are the six factors that should be considered:

1. Requirements Engineering

2. Expected Lifetime

3. Risk

4. Schedule Constraints

5. Interaction with Management/Customers

6. Expertise

***

Example:

What software modal would be best for an airplanes software control system?

Waterfall would be the best because with a control system the requirements are very well defined

-

Which software modal would you choose for a software project where you will be expecting multiple corrections?

Spiral/Agile because taking an iterative approach means you will be the most prepared for unexpected changes
